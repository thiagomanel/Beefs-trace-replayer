coordinator is our do-the-job script. Before running it, configure worker nodes. Mainly to allow no-pass ssh. Check cloudgley.README also.

Experiment uses input data and code stored and LSD nfs. To do so, we need to mount this file system at worker nodes.
We also need to sync worker node clocks, worker nodes must to their job as a group.

So, before proper execution we need the following config steps
	- allocate a number of instances. see "./allocate_cloudgley.sh $the_number"
      	- config no-pass. see "./config_cloudgley_ssh.sh"
        - config fstabs. see "./config_input_nfs.sh and ./config_replay_nfs.sh"
	- sync clocks. see "./sync_clock.sh
	- gives some permissive permissions to output directory
	- install 32 bits packages. see "install_libs32.sh"

Each sample runs according to this sketch:

	for i in range(num_samples)
		foreach worker_node:
			umount(replay_file_system)
			mount(replay_file_system)

		pre_replay(replay_file_system)
		check_pre_replay(replay_file_system)

		foreach worker_node:
			start_replay(worker_node, start_stamp)#they should start at the same time

		wait_replay(worker_nodes)
		foreach worker_node:
			copy_results(worker_node)#copy to nfs home

		roll_back_filesystem()
