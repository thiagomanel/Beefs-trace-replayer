+++ process/schedtimes.stp (checked)
	* The schedtimes.stp script instruments the scheduler to track the amount of time that each process spends in running, sleeping, queuing, and waiting for io. On exit the script prints out the accumulated time for each state of processes observed. Optionally, this script can be used with the '-c' or '-x' options to focus on a specific PID.
++ process/sleepingBeauties.stp (checked)
	* The script monitors the time that threads spend in waiting for IO operations (in "D" state) in the wait_for_completion function. If a thread spends over 10ms, its name and backtrace is printed, and later so is the total delay.
+ profiling/latencytap.stp (checked)
	* The latencytap.stp script collects data on the intervals processes are deactivated (sleeping). The script categorizes the reasons for the sleeps by analyzing the backtraces and displays a sorted list of the top 20 causes from largest total sum time sleeping to smallest. The output is updated every 30 seconds. The script needs to be compiled with the '--all-modules' option to produce reasons for sleeps caused by modules. Optionally, this script can be used with the '-c' or '-x' options to focus on a specific PID.
+++ profiling/sched_switch.stp (checked)
	* The sched_switch.stp script takes two arguments, first argument can be "pid" or "name" to indicate what is being passed as second argument. The script will trace the process based on pid/name and print the scheduler switches happening with the process. If no arguments are passed, it displays all the scheduler switches. This can be used to understand which tasks schedule out the current process being traced, and when it gets scheduled in again.
	* Note: It'd be nice to learn how to use the scheduler.wakeup and scheduler.ctxswitch probes, since kernel.function seems to no work properly
+ profiling/thread-times.stp (checked)
	* It the same http://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/WSthreadCPUshare script
	* The thread-times.stp script sets up time-based sampling. Every five seconds it prints out a sorted list with the top twenty threads occupying the CPUs, broken down as a percentage of user and kernel time.
	* NOTE: It the same http://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/WSthreadCPUshare script. In the war stories page it has the followin description: It is hard to tell how much time any given thread is spending in kernel vs. user space. Some statistics are available to user space, and some others only to the scheduler. But all in one place? Nope.
++ io/ioblktime.stp (checked)
	* The ioblktime.stp script tracks the amount of time that each block IO requests spend waiting for completion. The script computes the average waiting time for block IO per device and prints list every 10 seconds. In some cases there can be too many outstanding block IO operations and the script may exceed the default number of MAXMAPENTRIES allowed. In this case the allowed number can be increased with "-DMAXMAPENTRIES=10000" option on the stap command line.
	* Note: It'd be nice to filter by the related tid, pid
+++ process/cycle_thief.stp (checked)
	* The cycle_thief.stp script instruments the scheduler and IRQ handler to determine which processes and interrupts are competing with the specified task for the cpu cycles. This script uses the '-c' or '-x' options to focus on a specific task. The script output the number of times the task migrates between processors, histograms showing the length of time on and off processor, lists of processes running while the task is off the processor, and the interrupts that occurred while the task was running.
	* Note: Is it helpful to log the IRQs ?
+ general/stopwatches.stp (checked)
	* The stopwatch.stp script illustrates how to use multiple stopwatches record how much wallclock time a process spends in kernel- and user-space. On exit the script prints out the time in seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. Note that this output of this script is not directly comparable to the time command because time records the time that the process is actually active in kernel- and user-space.
+++ process/syscalltimes (checked)
	* Combination shell/systemtap script to measure system call counts and times. Can be filtered by process IDs, process names and users.
	* Note: It gives a good overview of system spent time
