Acceptance tests

replayer_test.sh - It takes a trace file and convert it to a workflow input file. After this, it replays the workflow file and trace the replay process using strace linux tool. Then, strace output is matched against workflow input file using replay ordering and time rules.

replay_workflow_test.sh - It takes a workflow input file directly. Replay and matching run as in replayer_test.sh script described above. replay_workflow_test.sh isolates replay from trace input file processing and parsing.

TODO: I think we should not need to keep both. Instead, keep replay_workflow_test.sh and create code to test trace input to workflow input conversion
