Trace treatment includes 
    1. filter_trace.sh (./filter_trace.sh raw_data_dir_fullpath) - It outputs .filtered files
    2. sort.sh (./sort.sh raw_data_dir_fullpath) - it sorts filtered files withing a directory. It outputs .sort files
    3. join_sort.sh (./join_sort.sh raw_data_dir_fullpath outputname) it concats and sort sorted files
    4. clean_trace.py (python clean_trace.py < filename.join > filename.clean 2> filename.clean.err- translates relative paths to fullpaths and other sugar sintaxes to fit into replayer format. For some calls that manipulate fd, it tries to associate its fullpath by relating to open call. For this reason, this script needs input to be timestamp ordered
    5. trace2workflow.py (python trace2workflow.py < file.clean > file.pidfid_order) - It applies pid_tid and fs dependencies ordering.
