Trace treatment includes 
    1. filter_trace.sh (./filter_trace.sh raw_data_dir_fullpath) - It outputs .filtered files
    2. sort.sh (./sort.sh raw_data_dir_fullpath) - it sorts filtered files withing a directory. It outputs .sort files
    3. join_sort.sh (./join_sort.sh raw_data_dir_fullpath outputname) it concats and sort sorted files
    4. clean_trace.py (python clean_trace.py < filename.join > filename.clean 2> filename.clean.err- translates relative paths to fullpaths and other sugar sintaxes to fit into replayer format. For some calls that manipulate fd, it tries to associate its fullpath by relating to open call. For this reason, this script needs input to be timestamp ordered
    5. trace2workflow.py (python trace2workflow.py < file.clean > file.pidfid_order) - It applies pid_tid and fs dependencies ordering. 
# 1. to resolve pre-replay
# 	python pre_replay.py replay_dir < workflow.order > pre_replay.out
# 2. to define file sizes
# 	python pre_replay_fsize.py pre_replay.out replay_leading_path workflow.order > replay_fsize.out
# 3. merge pre-replay and file size definition
#	python merge_pre_replay_and_fsize.py replay_fsize pre_replay.out > merged.out
